# API Lua üåò

API to generate astrological charts using [Kerykeion](https://github.com/g-battaglia/kerykeion), a Python library for astrology that calculates planetary and house positions, detects aspects, and generates SVG charts, including natal, synastry, transit, and composite charts. The API also allows customization of which planets to include in the calculations and uses the full version of [Pyswisseph](https://github.com/astrorigin/pyswisseph), a Python implementation of the [Swiss Ephemeris](https://www.astro.com/swisseph/).
